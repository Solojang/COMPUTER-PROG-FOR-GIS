***Tutorial of process Raster with python***

**This is a basic tutorial about how to process Raster fiel(tiff).**
**in this tutorial, I will demostrate how to plot grah and chart by using Python code.**

Before we get start, remenber to download the hard data in this repo [data](https://github.com/Solojang/COMPUTER-PROG-FOR-GIS/tree/main/data).
The raw data was download from [mapbiosmas](https://mapbiomas.org/download).
the size of the raw data is **1000 pixels *1000 pixels with 30 meters resolution,with 10 time points ranging from 1986 to 2004, with a time interval of 2 years between time points**.
The location of this data is **Northeast of the Brazillian state of Mato Grosso**.
The categories of this data is: **Forest, Non Forest Natural  Formation, Farming, Non Vegetated Area, Water**

**Notice the study area is not a big area, because we do not want make runtime problems.**

in this repo [data](https://github.com/Solojang/COMPUTER-PROG-FOR-GIS/tree/main/data). I did some preprocessing for the raw data. 
**If you want to download data yourself, remember to preprocess the data first.**

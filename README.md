Before we get start, remenber to download the hard data in this repo [data](https://github.com/Solojang/COMPUTER-PROG-FOR-GIS/tree/main/data).

the size of the raw data is **1000 pixels *1000 pixels with 30 meters resolution,with 10 time points ranging from 1986 to 2004, with a time interval of 2 years between time points**.
The location of this data is **Northeast of the Brazillian state of Mato Grosso**.
The categories of this data is: **Forest, Non Forest Natural  Formation, Farming, Non Vegetated Area, Water**
